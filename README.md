# fulsome-corgi

Ruby project to keep an archive of your [Instagram](http://instagram.com) likes

## Why?

Instagram only keeps your 300 most recent liked photos and videos, which I found
out conveniently when I already liked more than 300 items. This repo will allow
you to provide your account details and link your preferred storage account to
have an archive of your favorite Instagram photos and videos!
